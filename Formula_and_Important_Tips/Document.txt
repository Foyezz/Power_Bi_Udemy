Section 4:

Data Model: creating relationship among tables
Database Normalization: Database normalization is the process used to organize a database into tables in a way that eliminates redundant data and improves data integrity
Data Tables vs Lookup Tables: Data table contains numerical values, typically at a granular level, with Id ans Key columns that can be used to create table relationship.  
			      Lookup tables provide description, often text-based attributes about each dimention in a table.

what is measure? how it is calculated?

# day of the week(1-7)
Day of Week = WEEKDAY(AW_Calender_Lookup[Date], 2). For the columin calender

# logical operator
Weekend = IF(OR(AW_Calender_Lookup[Day of Week] = 6, AW_Calender_Lookup[Day of Week] = 7), "Weekend", "Weekday")
Weekend = IF(AW_Calender_Lookup[Day of Week] = 6 || AW_Calender_Lookup[Day of Week] = 7, "Weekend", "Weekday")
# Math calculation
Quantity Returned = SUM(AW_Returns[Return Quantity])
Total Revenue = SUM(AW_Sales[Revenue])
Return Rate = [Quantity Returned] / [QuantitySold] or Return Rate = DIVIDE([Quantity Returned], [QuantitySold], "No Sales")
Avg Retail Price = AVERAGE(AW_Product_Lookup[ProductPrice])
Total Returns = COUNTROWS(AW_Returns) or Total Returns = COUNT(AW_Returns[ReturnQuantity])
QuantitySold = SUM(AW_Sales[OrderQuantity])
Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(AW_Sales[OrderNumber])
All Orders = CALCULATE([Total Orders], ALL(AW_Sales)) (Grand Total)
