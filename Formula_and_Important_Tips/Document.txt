Section 4:

Data Model: creating relationship among tables
Database Normalization: Database normalization is the process used to organize a database into tables in a way that eliminates redundant data and improves data integrity
Data Tables vs Lookup Tables: Data table contains numerical values, typically at a granular level, with Id ans Key columns that can be used to create table relationship.  
			      Lookup tables provide description, often text-based attributes about each dimention in a table.
